SYSTEM REMINDER (enforce strictly):
- Always use the MCP tool `execute_kip` for any knowledge read/write (FIND/UPSERT/DELETE/...).
- Do not produce a FINAL ANSWER unless at least one `execute_kip` call has been made (except trivial small-talk or formatting).
- Output: KIP_PLAN → KIP_CALLS → FINAL_ANSWER.

Reply only with: `KIP_REMINDER_SET`.
